Little script wrote to run the airframes acars javascript/typescript libary from python.

Wrote using example code from the airframes acars decoder here https://github.com/airframesio/acars-decoder-typescript.

To run
Install NPM 18 or newer and install https://pypi.org/project/javascript/ module.

Pass message label and encoded acars text to run_all_decode function to download the Airframes acars library and decode the text.
