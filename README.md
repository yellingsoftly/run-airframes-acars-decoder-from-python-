Little script wrote using example code from the airframes acars decoder here https://github.com/airframesio/acars-decoder-typescript.

Install NPM 18 or newer and install https://pypi.org/project/javascript/ module so you can run javascript from python use node.js.

Pass message label and encoded acars text to run_all_decode function to download the Airframes acars library and decode the text.
